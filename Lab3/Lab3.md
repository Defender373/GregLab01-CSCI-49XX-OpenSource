i. Machine Learning and Stock Predictions
ii. Other Stock Market Predictors. Many are private so I am unable to compare
iii. Would use TensorFlow, R, Stock Market API's, and ARIMA modeling
iv. The end product will be able to track the price of its users stocks in the market. It will record the price and quanitity of the stock purchased, and will have real time recommendations on when to buy and sell that stock. Also the product will be able to predict prices based on the stock's price history, and can recommend to its users which stocks are worth investing in.
