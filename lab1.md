2. Please read Eric Raymond's article Smart Questions How to ask the question The Smart Way . - Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience) - List at least two.
- If you answer a question by referencing a specific source, mention the source in your post so that others can understand your solution and possibly find solutions to their future problems.

3. Please read chapter 3 of Free Culture. Write a short paragraph ( 8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
- I learned that I need to be mindful of how my program/code will be used by other students/people. The data and/or information that users can store or intract with my program could be subject to copyright laws. When I am creating a program, I need to be mindful of what type of information I want to be used. If I am working with sensitve copyrighted information such as music, I need to be extra careful that my work is respecting copyright laws. If I make programs available to online public users I should add disclaimers about using sensitive copyright materials. As a safeguard I should add code to prevent users from using my program in ways that could potentially violate copyright laws. Once I start working as a professional programmer I should keep a lawyer/firm in mind incase a lawsuit was to happen to me. Lastly I should make sure that I have a thorough understanding of how copyright laws work and how the open source licenses I use can apply to them.

Reflection
1. The project that I'm working on: Project MxM
2. Stocker: An app that tracks your stocks and recommends buying/selling
3. I would use an API that can track a particular stock for free. I would record the amount of stock bought and what price it was at. The program would keep track of the price and record when a pit is happening (they can buy more) or a peak is happening (they should sell). I will use my previous research in ARIMA modeling to help calculate better average prices for better sell/buy decision making.
